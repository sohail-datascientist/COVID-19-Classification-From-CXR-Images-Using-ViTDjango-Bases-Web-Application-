**Introduction to the Project**

The Final Year Project (FYP), titled **COVID-19 Classification from CXR Images Using Deep Learning Techniques (Vision Transformers)**, is a web-based system developed to facilitate COVID-19 diagnosis by analyzing chest X-ray images through advanced deep learning models. This project, supervised by **Mr. Syed Muzamil Hussain Shah**  (https://www.linkedin.com/in/muzamilhussain/), utilizes multiple deep learning models to explore the efficacy of AI in classifying COVID-19 cases. Specifically, several architectures were evaluated, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Among the studied models, the Vision Transformer (ViT) demonstrated superior performance, accurately classifying COVID-19 cases with high precision and robust generalization capabilities across varied datasets.

The ViT modelâ€™s effectiveness lies in its self-attention mechanism, which allows it to focus on critical regions in X-ray images that indicate COVID-19 or other lung-related diseases. As a result, this project not only aids in rapid COVID-19 diagnosis but also serves as a versatile tool for medical practitioners and the general public. The platform provides a user-friendly online interface for X-ray classification and a dynamic dashboard displaying global COVID-19 statistics, significantly contributing to timely and accessible healthcare solutions amid the pandemic. This project illustrates the potential of AI, particularly Vision Transformers, to support healthcare innovation and enhance diagnostic capabilities in real-world applications.
